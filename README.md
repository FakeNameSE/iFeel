# iFeel

The culmination of technical progress -- three hundred thousand years of evolution have at last culminated in a social media app capable of providing people with truly vacuous social interaction and validation.

Specifically, this is a group messenger that allows people to interact with others using a limited subset of emotions and feign carring about others emotions with a bot.

The inspiration for the name comes from an imaginary app in the novel *The Nix* by Nathan Hill.

## What is this and why the excellent clashing color scheme?
